        <h3>Unique Blends</h3>
        <p><b>Headline:</b>WakeCup takes pride in the estates and plantations that we work with. From the
            day of our inception, it has been our endeavour to reach out to the finest plantations from
            across the planet to bring you the finest blends. To that end, we source our beans from
            ecologically sustainable and responsible estates from around the world. Our collection is
            thus small but once you’ve tried our unique blends, you’ll never go back.</p>
